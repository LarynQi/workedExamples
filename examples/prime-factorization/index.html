	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization#Prime_decomposition">Prime factorization</a> is the process of 
	decomposing an integer into factors that are prime numbers.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">The fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> states 
	that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. Here are examples of prime factorizations:

	<ul>
		<li>14 = 2 x 7</li>
		<li>25 = 5 x 5</li>
		<li>99 = 3 x 3 x 11</li>
		<li>255 = 3 x 5 x 17</li>
		<li>1234 = 2 x 617</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>
	Write a program that continually reads in an integer and outputs its prime factors. You may want to decompose 
	the problem by creating the following functions:
	<ul>
		<li>A function that checks if its argument is prime. 
			Note that a prime numer is a number that is not multiple of any number other than 1 and itself.</li>
		<li>
			A function that returns the smallest prime factor of its argument.
			That is, the smallest prime number greater than 1 that evenly divides the argument. 
		</li>
		<li>
			A function that shows the prime factors of a number by repeatedly finding its smallest prime factor 
			and repeating the same process on the remaining quotient until the remaining quotient is 1.
		</li>

	</ul>
