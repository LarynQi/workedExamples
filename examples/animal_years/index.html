	Other animals typically have different lifespans than humans. If you divide the average human lifespan by the average lifespan of another animal, you can calculate the multiplier for converting an age in human years to an age in animal years. For example, the average lifespan of a human is 79 years and the average lifespan of a dog is 11 years. So, 1 human year is equal to 79/11 = 7.18 dog years. Then, to convert say 3 human years to dog years, you'd multiply 3 * 7.18 = 21.54 dog years. That means, if your dog is 3 years old in human years, they're past their teenage years in dog years!

	Since the multipliers for each animal will never change, you should store these as constants.
