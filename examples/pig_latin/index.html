	1) If word begins with consonant sound, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence, then, 'ay' is added. 
</p>

<p>
    2) If word begins with vowel sounds or a silent letter, one just adds 'yay' to the end.

	3) The cases of individual words are to be preserved. For example, for the sentence: 'Who are you?', the title case of the word 'who' is preserved after translation, so the translation is 'Owhay areyay ouyay?'.
