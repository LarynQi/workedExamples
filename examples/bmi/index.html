<p>
	The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese
	based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.
	<br/>
	Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).
</p>

<p> Write a program that continually reads in mass and height from the user and
	then outputs if the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. Show your work in the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<center>
	<img style="width:400px" src="./demo.png">
</center>
<p></p>
<p>
	If you ask the user to input weight in kilograms (m) and height in meter (h),
	the result of calculating BMI = <i>m</i> / <i>(h * h)</i> will be in kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
	The program will then output if the user is underweight etc based on the BMI.
