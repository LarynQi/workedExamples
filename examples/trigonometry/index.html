	There are relationships between the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles of a triangle. Trigonometry
	is the branch of mathematics that studies such relationships. <br />

	The following trigonometric ratios are defined for the acute angles (an angle smaller than 90 degrees) of a right triangle:
	<ul>
		<li>The cosine of the angle is equal to the length of the side adjacent to that angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.</li>
		<li>The sine of the angle is equal to the length of the side opposite to that angle divided by the length hypotenuse.</li>
	</ul>
	Note: the length of the hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pytagorean theorem (in a right triangle, the square
	of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.)

	Write a program that continually reads in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the followings:
	<ul>
		<li>The sine of the angle ABC</li>
		<li>The cosine of the angle ABC</li>
		<li>The sum of the squares of the above two results</li>
	</ul>
	What do you notice? Can you explain? <br />
	Below are examples of the program's inputs and outputs:

<pre>
Enter the length of AB: <span class="blue">3</span>
Enter the length of AC: <span class="blue">4</span>
cos(ABC) = 0.6
sin(ABC) = 0.8
cos(ABC)^2 + sin(ABC)^2= 1.0

Enter the length of AB: <span class="blue">1</span>
Enter the length of AC: <span class="blue">1</span>
cos(ABC) = 0.7071067811865475
sin(ABC) = 0.7071067811865475
cos(ABC)^2 + sin(ABC)^2= 0.9999999999999998

Enter the length of AB: <span class="blue">4</span>
Enter the length of AC: <span class="blue">3</span>
cos(ABC) = 0.8
sin(ABC) = 0.6
cos(ABC)^2 + sin(ABC)^2= 1.0
