	The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry.
	It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

	For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem: <br />
	<strong>BC<sup>2</sup> = AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup></strong>
	<br />
	which implies that: <br />
	<strong>BC = sqrt(AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup>)</strong> &nbsp; (sqrt means squared root)<br />
</p>

<p>Write a program that continually reads in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length
	of the hypotenuse (BC). Below are examples of inputs and outputs of the program.</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="console" style="width:500px">
Enter the length of AB: <span class="blue">3</span>
Enter the length of AC: <span class="blue">4</span>
The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0

Enter the length of AB: <span class="blue">1</span>
Enter the length of AC: <span class="blue">1</span>
The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 1.4142135623730951
