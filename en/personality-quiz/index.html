				<h1>Personality Quiz</h1>
				<p class="subtleHeading">By Daniel Classon, inspired by Facebook quarantine games</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>
	Since quarantine began, my Facebook has been taken over by various logical and astrological (just teasing!) quizzes. However, none of the quizzes were about a very important topic... me. That's why I came up with my very own personality quiz! You should have all the tools you need to build your own. We'll even include a correct-answer-counter to make the quiz more competitive--then you'll know who really knows you best.
</p>

<p> 
	Write a program that asks the user multiple choice questions about you (or anything, really). The quiz should include at least 3 questions that have at least 3 choices each.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user should be instructed how to enter their answer.</li>
	<li>After each question, the user should be told if they got the question right or wrong.</li>
	<li>At the end of the quiz, the user should be told their score (the number of correct answers).</li>
	<li>Each run of the program only needs to play the quiz once.</li>
	<li>You can assume the user will only enter valid guesses for each question.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<pre class="console" style="width:500px">
Welcome to the Quiz! How well do you know Daniel?
Instructions: select your answer by inputing a, b, or c.
########## 1 ##########
Question 1: what pet does Daniel have?
a. Dog
b. Cat
c. Snake
Type a, b, or c and hit enter: a
That's incorrect...
########## 2 ##########
Question 2: which does Daniel hate the most?
a. Hangnails
b. Waking up early
c. Stories with no emotional resolution
Type a, b, or c and hit enter: c
That's right!
########## 3 ##########
Question 3: what is Daniel doing on a Sunday morning?
a. Sleeping in
b. Eating homemade brunch
c. Working out
Type a, b, or c and hit enter: a
That's right!
--------------------
That's the end of our quiz!
Congratulations! You got 2 questions right!
</pre>
<p></p>

<p> 
	For clarity, I suggest keeping your Question/Answer format as multiple choice. However, there's nothing stopping you from including True/False or Fill-In-The-Blank questions! We'll count that as extra credit.</p>
<p>
	I hope you have fun making this and sharing this with your friends and family!
</p>
<p>
	Once you've learned a bit more, this quiz is a great place for some easy ~extensions~!! Here are some ways you can expand your quiz down the line:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The quiz can be run multiple times</li>
	<li>The name and score of players is recorded on a Leaderboard</li>
	<li>The order of the answers is shuffled to prevent easy memorization</li>
	<li>Each quiz consists of 10 questions randomly chosen from a list of 50+</li>
	<li>Bonus points are earned by correctly answering questions quickly</li>
</ul>

	# Counter variable to keep track of correct answers

	print(&quot;--------------------&quot;)
	print(&quot;That&#039;s the end of our quiz!&quot;)
	print(&quot;Congratulations! You got &quot; + str(num_correct) + &quot; questions right!&quot;)

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Each question has a correct answer of either a, b, or c.
If the user inputs the correct answer, returns True. Otherwise,
returns False.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
def question_1():
	print(&quot;########## 1 ##########&quot;)
	print(&quot;Question 1: what pet does Daniel have?&quot;)
	print(&quot;a. Dog&quot;)
	print(&quot;b. Cat&quot;)
	print(&quot;c. Snake&quot;)

	response = input(&quot;Type a, b, or c and hit enter: &quot;)
	
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	The correct answer is b!
	This is a clever way to return True or False on one line
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	return response == &quot;b&quot;

def question_2():
	print(&quot;########## 2 ##########&quot;)
	print(&quot;Question 2: which does Daniel hate the most?&quot;)
	print(&quot;a. Hangnails&quot;)
	print(&quot;b. Waking up early&quot;)
	print(&quot;c. Stories with no emotional resolution&quot;)

	response = input(&quot;Type a, b, or c and hit enter: &quot;)
	
	return response == &quot;c&quot;

def question_3():
	print(&quot;########## 3 ##########&quot;)
	print(&quot;Question 3: what is Daniel doing on a Sunday morning?&quot;)
	print(&quot;a. Sleeping in&quot;)
	print(&quot;b. Eating homemade brunch&quot;)
	print(&quot;c. Working out&quot;)

	response = input(&quot;Type a, b, or c and hit enter: &quot;)
	
	return response == &quot;a&quot;
